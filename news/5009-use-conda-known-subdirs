### Enhancements

* Use subdirs known to conda for selector definitions. (#5009)
  This allows conda_build to support new architectures with just
  a new version of conda. For new OSes, there are more information
  needed for conda_build to work properly, including whether the
  new OS is a UNIX-like platform, the shared library prefix, and
  the binary archive format for the platform.
