### Enhancements

* Added SHA224, SHA384 and SHA512 support for validating downloaded sources.

### Bug fixes

* If multiple hashing algorithms are used to validate a downloaded source, a `RuntimeError` will now be thrown if **any** of those hashes are incorrect. This is stricter and more consistent than the previous behaviour.
