Enhancements:
-------------

* Update build.sh files of skeletons to be shellcheck clean including test to
  lint future updates. Also adding `set -o errexit -o pipefail` to build.sh
  files to make those settings transparent for better linting, while errexit was
  anyway already the default used the call the build script.
