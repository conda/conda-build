### Enhancements

* Add opt-in environment variable to run `conda` in isolated mode (`python -I -m conda`) when invoked from `conda-build`. This is necessary to fix an issue when packaging conda itself. Alternative solutions (see #4628) are under investigation, so the current implementation will likely change. (#4604, #4625)
