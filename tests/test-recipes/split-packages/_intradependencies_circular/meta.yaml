# What's supposed to happen here is:
#   1. a gets rendered.  It has an unresolved run_exports entry for b (just b, without the pin)
#   2. b gets rendered.  It has an exact reference to a.  This in turn will change b - and the loop goes on.
#      Conda-build should raise an error about the circular dependency.
