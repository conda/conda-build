    "Handling version compatibility is one of the hardest challenges in building software.  Up to now, conda-build provided helpful tools in terms of the ability to constrain or pin versions in recipes.  The limiting thing about this capability was that it entailed editing a lot of recipes.  Conda-build 3 introduces a new scheme for controlling version constraints, which enhances behavior in two ways.  First, you can now set versions in an external file, and you can provide lists of versions for conda-build to loop over.  Matrix builds are now much simpler and no longer require an external tool, such as conda-build-all.  Second, there have been several new Jinja2 functions added, which allow recipe authors to express their constraints relative to the versions of packages installed at build time.  This dynamic expression greatly cuts down on the need for editing recipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these developments have enabled interesting new capabilities for cross-compiling, as well as improving package compatibility by adding more intelligent constraints."
