# This recipe exercises the use of GIT_ variables in jinja template strings,
# including use cases involving expressions such as FOO[:7] or FOO.replace(...)

# it uses functions from conda_build.jinja_context to populate some fields
# with values fed from setuptools.

# This is a legacy recipe - load_setuptools has been renamed
