  summary: 'Pyslet: Python package for Standards in Learning, Education and Training'
  description: |
    Pyslet is a Python package for Standards in Learning Education and Training
    (LET). It implements a number of LET-specific standards, including IMS QTI,
    Content Packaging and Basic LTI. It also includes support for some general
    standards, including the data access standard OData (see
    http://www.odata.org).

    Pyslet was originally written to be the engine behind the QTI migration
    tool but it can be used independently as a support module for your own
    Python applications.

    Pyslet currently supports Python 2.6 and 2.7, see docs for details.
