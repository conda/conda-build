  # Inheriting environment variables like this is a bit of an anti-pattern,
  # but it's the best mechanism we currently have for allowing flexibility
  # in where the macOS SDK needed for this test is installed.  Assuming or
  # forcing developers and/or CI systems to put the needed SDK in the same
  # place just to run this test seems like an even bigger anti-pattern.
