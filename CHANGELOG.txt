2016-12-20 2.1.0beta1:

Enhancements:
-------------

* Consolidate package metadata from extra.json and noarch.json into package_metadata.json #1535 #1539
* finalize paths.json, (formerly files.json), which supersedes the older separate files for tracking file data #1535
* Support output of multiple packages from one recipe #1576
* Support output of wheels #1576
* Add ``--prefix-length`` to conda-build.  This allows one to set the prefix length manually.  It should be used sparingly, preferring creation of a temporary folder on non-encrypted locations, and setting ``--croot`` to that temporary folder.  #1579
* Add ``--no-prefix-length-fallback`` option to conda-build, to fail builds that encounter short prefixes, rather than falling back to the short prefix #1579
* Change CRAN-skeleton to follow conda-forge style #1596

Bug fixes:
----------

* Rework locks to be more robust #1540
* Call make_hardlink_copy on Windows to prevent conda failures #1575
* Delete the work folder before running the test suite.  Exposes faulty links to source files more easily.  #1581
* Add support for Python 3.6 in selector expressions #1592
* Don't try to compile pyc files when python is not installed in the build env #1593
* Fix a function call leading to corrupted meta.yaml output #1589
* Fix logger to be package-local.  Fixes logger output not showing up.  #1583
* Disallow leading periods in package version  #1594
* Fix reference to undefined need_source_download #1595
* Disallow - in feature names, to avoid conflicts with conda's handling of package names #1600

 * Environment activation requires conda >=4.1.6.  The activate.bat script does not look in the right place for the activate.d folder.
 * The test suite on Linux and Mac fails the python-build, python-run, and python-build-run tests, because an errant __conda-version__.txt file is somehow present.  It is not clear where it comes from, and each of these tests pass when run individually.  If you have mysterious issues, and you use __conda-version__.txt or files like it, please file an issue.

2016-06-27 1.21.3:
------------------

Bug fixes:
----------

 * Fix a regression in Windows, where a compiler was a hard requirement, and was not always showing up, anyway.  #1049

Contributors:
 * @msarahan

2016-06-24 1.21.2:
------------------

Bug fixes / Improvements:
-------------------------

 * revert some MSVC activation logic to still call vcvarsall directly in build script
 * fix Windows testing for binary prefix replacement (not done on win)
 * Add a warning message when conda-build can't create an environment due to unsatisfiable dependencies
 * Improve notion of whether a recipe uses a VCS in its metadata, or in its build

Known issues:
-------------

 * Environment activation on Windows will not work until Conda 4.1.4 is released.  The activate.bat script does not look in the right place for the activate.d folder.
 * The test suite on Linux and Mac fails the python-build, python-run, and python-build-run tests, because an errant __conda-version__.txt file is somehow present.  It is not clear where it comes from, and each of these tests pass when run individually.  If you have mysterious issues, and you use __conda-version__.txt or files like it, please file an issue.

2016-06-15 1.21.0:
------------------

New stuff:
----------
 * Add FEATURE_ environment variables for MKL, opt and debugging #978
 * add info/about.json file that contains the "about" section of meta.yaml #941
 * allow ```--dirty``` flag to be passed to ```conda build``` command. Skips
   download, and provides DIRTY environment variable in build scripts. #973
 * Add msys2 paths to build and test environments #979
 * add new x86 and x86_64 selectors for Intel platforms #986
 * keep original meta.yaml in recipe folder of package; create meta.yaml.rendered in recipe folder.  Neither exist when recipe not included.  #1004
 * add ignore_prefix_files key to build in meta.yaml. Can ignore list of files,
   or True to ignore all prefix files. #1008 #1009
 * Automatically determine patch strip level #1011

Bug fixes/Improvements:
-----------------------
 * Lightened requirement that x.x be defined in both build and runtime sections.  #650
 * Remove info/recipe.json from build conda packages.  Superseded by info/recipe/meta.yaml.rendered.  #781
 * Search for single and double backslashes when finding files that need prefix replacement #962
 * Track undefined jinja variables and use them to decide whether to download source #964
 * handle patches with p0 or p1 #969, #1011, #1020
 * only set os.environ for non-None variables #981
 * Don't use long prefixes on windows #985
 * Fix missing encoding argument #987
 * Respect proxy variables more appropriately #989
 * Search packages on PyPI, rather than listing them all.  Should avoid some timeout errors there. #991
 * Fix unix-style paths returned from git on Windows preventing relative paths from providing Jinja2 metadata #995
 * improve logic handling "dirty" downloading.  Always download when not dirty.  #995
 * Fix post-build variables when no build section existed in original meta.yaml #999
 * Activate _build and _test environments approriately, rather than manipulating PATH directly #1002
 * Don't clone git submodules until after first checkout #1025
 * Move check_install over from conda.install #1027

Deprecations:
-------------
 * __conda_version__.txt and other post-build methods of altering the build
   string are marked as deprecated. Prefer Jinja2 templates where possible.
   Create issues if this breaks your work.

2016-05-13 1.20.3:
------------------
Features:
 * use posix metapackage for cran skeleton packaging (#956)

Bug fixes:
 * fix output of package paths (extra output was breaking tools).  Add tests. (#950)
 * change default of no_download_source in build.py (for compatibility with conda-build-all) (#950)
 * fix regression in [] being confused for selectors (#957)

2016-05-13 1.20.2:
------------------
Features:
 * added --token and --user flags to pass corresponding information to anaconda upload (#921)
 * added conda render command that outputs a fully-rendered meta.yaml to either stdout, or to file (with --file) (#908)
 * support source checkout tools specified in meta.yaml. If source checkout fails at the rendering phase, source checkout and rendering are re-done after the build environment is created. (#843, #946)
 * fn is now optional when a URL specifies a filename. (#942)
 * CRAN skeleton generator now uses MSYS2 for Windows support (#942)
 * conda build & conda render both recursively look for meta.yaml (support conda-forge feedstock submodules) (#908)
 * Whitelist MAKEFLAGS environment variable. Setting this outside conda build should take effect in your build. Parallelize on *nix by adding -j here, instead of -j${CPU_COUNT} in your build.sh. This helps on CI's, where CPU_COUNT is not always well-behaved. (#917)
 * Run python_d executable on windows when debug feature is active (#724)
 * add conda build flag --keep-old-work that temporarily moves your last build, then moves it back after completion. For debugging, when more than one package is involved. (#833)

Bug fixes:
 * fixed several instances wherein --skip-existing did not work (#897, #945)
 * Fully render recipe before outputting build string  * fixes empty spots where GIT_* info should have been (#923)

 * Address PyPI's change of URL format (#922,
 * Fix invalid gcc "-m 32" flag (#916)
 * Fix empty section (due to selectors) handling regression (#919)
 * Fix regression in handling of VS2008 Pro (not Express + VC for Python 2.7). It is important to at least try to run vcvarsall.bat. (#913)
 * Fix CPAN skeleton generator (handle missing sections better) (#912)
 * Make test/requires versions match build/requires without additional pinning (#907)
 * Remove hard-coded CYGWIN path from conda-build's custom PATH (#903)
 * Source is downloaded before testing, fixing an issue where if build machine and some other test machine had different source, strange things happened. (#946)
 * Fix regression with Python 3.x fixing shebangs (#892)
 * Fix conda inspect crashes by using conda-meta info rather than filenames or dist names for package info (#947)

 * PEP8 cleanup; use flake8 rather than pyflakes (#938)
 * limited scope of project locking to avoid lock conflicts between build and rendering (#923)
 * set up anaconda.org build infrastructure (#924)

-------------------
  * the yaml script tag was only written if build.sh already existed,
    see issue #105
  * use tests_require to fill in test requirements in the setuptools
    template, see issue #107

  * conda convert now creates platform directories, like
    win-32/converted_package.tar.bz2

    (it will ignore the CONDA_PY, CONDA_NPY, or CONDA_PERL, respectively, in
    this case)


2014-04-15   1.3.2:
-------------------
  * allow changing conda-bld directory (which is by default <root>/conda-bld
    when the conda root is not writable, and ~/conda-bld otherwise), to be
    changed by CONDA_BLD_PATH environment variable or conda-build: root-dir:
    in condarc file
  * add build/has_prefix_files

2014-03-25   1.3.1:
-------------------
  * add conda metapackage command
  * fix recursive conda building when dependencies are nested more than one
    level deep.

  * add the --recursive option to conda skeleton pypi
  * conda skeleton pypi no longer asks about single line licenses

  * conda skeleton pypi now works in a different conda environment. This
    avoids anything bad that might happen when trying to get the metadata from
    the package from messing up the root environment.
  * conda skeleton pypi now patches distribute directly. This is more robust
    than trying to insert a patch into setup.py, as was done previously.
  * allow to set the version post-build by writing a __conda_version__.txt
    file to the source directory.
  * add ability to skip binary relocation step by
    setting "build/binary_relocation: False" in meta.yaml


2014-03-14   1.3.0:
-------------------
  * add skeleton for CPAN Perl packages, issue #53. Unlike
    the PyPI skeleton, it supports a --recursive option to
    also generate the recipes for all of the dependencies of
    a given module/distribution
  * add support for run_test.pl and Perl import tests when
    building Perl packages
  * add CONDA_PERL environment variable support for
    determining which version of Perl to build packages for.
    Unlike CONDA_PY, this must include the full version with
    periods (e.g., 5.18.2)
  * automatically build packages for dependencies if the recipe is
    present in the current working directory
  * fix a number of Python 3 compatibility issues, issue #59
  * work with source files with uppercase suffixes

  * allow to add run_test.sh or run_test.bat, which will be run automatically
    during the test phase.
  * Test commands from the test/commands section of meta.yaml are run from
    bash on Linux and OS X and batch on Windows (previously they were run
    using Python's subprocess).
  * all environment variables from the build process are available during the
    tests, except with the build prefix replaced with the test prefix.
