    which points to the environment lib directory, and use and install name
    using @rpath
  * don't set DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH in cran recipes (the new LC_RPATH
    logic on OS X makes this unnecessary)
  * fix conda build --build-only when the long build prefix is used

    of environment variable names which are made available in the build
    script.  If a variable is listed here, but is not in the environment,
    the value '<UNDEFINED>' is assigned.
  * Handle OSError in conda index
  * Fix how the PATH environment variable is set on Windows
  * Remove the work directory earlier in the build

  * Handle non-directories in copy_into (avoids an OSError, #332)
  * Halt the build on YAML error without jinja2
  * Clone git sources with the --recursive option
  * Add --channel and --override-channels to conda build. -c is changed to
    mean --channel instead of --check.
  * Add --check-md5 flag to conda index
  * Look for vcvarsall.bat from the Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7
  * Use PyPi XMLRCP client search in order to ignore case for PyPi package
    names in pipbuild

2015-01-15   1.10.0:
--------------------
  * automatically convert absolute symlinks to paths in the build prefix to
    relative ones.
  * error if there are symlinks to the source directory.
  * use the placeholder prefix in text files rather than the build prefix
  * allow non-Python packages to be converted to other platforms with conda
    convert
  * new command conda inspect for inspecting packages. The only subcommand so
    far is conda inspect linkages, which shows the dynamic linkages of the
    shared object files on Linux.
  * correctly handle Unix style has_prefixes on Windows
  * run the tests in Binstar build
  * only modify egg directories that are part of the package being built

  * also grab the full HEAD sha1 and shove it into the environmental
    variable GIT_FULL_HASH
  * automatically detect text prefix files
  * add detect_binary_files_with_prefix flag to meta.yaml to automatically
    detect binary files with the prefix and add them to

  * conda convert now creates platform directories, like
    win-32/converted_package.tar.bz2
  * allow to specify the version of python, numpy, or perl in the meta.yaml
    (it will ignore the CONDA_PY, CONDA_NPY, or CONDA_PERL, respectively, in
    this case)


2014-04-15   1.3.2:
-------------------
  * allow changing conda-bld directory (which is by default <root>/conda-bld
    when the conda root is not writable, and ~/conda-bld otherwise), to be

    avoids anything bad that might happen when trying to get the metadata from
    the package from messing up the root environment.

    than trying to insert a patch into setup.py, as was done previously.

    expects the full path to the recipe

  * allow to add run_test.sh or run_test.bat, which will be run automatically
    during the test phase.

    bash on Linux and OS X and batch on Windows (previously they were run
    using Python's subprocess).

    tests, except with the build prefix replaced with the test prefix.
