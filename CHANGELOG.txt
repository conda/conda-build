2016-08-22 2.0.0beta2:

This release includes all current (1.21.14) changes made to the 1.21.x series.

Enhancements:
-------------

* Configuration is local, passed via config argument.  No more global config.  #953
* Created Python API in conda_build/api.py #953
* Separate build folders per-build to allow parallelism #953
* Add locking to allow safe parallelism #953
* Add build flag to turn off separate build folders (--no-build-id) #953
* Much greater test coverage across all modules #953
* Add CONDA_BUILD_STATE variable that reflects RENDER, BUILD, or TEST state of build #1232
* Add support for HG_ variables in meta.yaml templates (for hg repos) #207 #1234
* Add source_files test argument in meta.yaml to copy files from source into test #1237

Bug fixes:
----------

* Fix error converting linux to win packages due to python version mismatch #481
* Fix infinite loop that occurred with circular dependencies being built #953
* Improve test data structures to allow profiling with pytest-profiling #953
* Fix version sorting in pypi skeleton generator #1238

Restructuring:
--------------

* CLI scripts have been gutted and moved to conda_build/cli.  Content from them is in
  conda_build, in scripts without main_ prefix.  #953
* Skeleton generators have been broken out of main_skeleton.py, and consolidated into
  conda_build/skeletons.  The contents of this folder are examined at runtime for pluggability.  #953

 * Improve notion of whether a recipe uses a VCS in its metadata, or in its build

Known issues:
-------------

 * Environment activation on Windows will not work until Conda 4.1.4 is released.  The activate.bat script does not look in the right place for the activate.d folder.
 * The test suite on Linux and Mac fails the python-build, python-run, and python-build-run tests, because an errant __conda-version__.txt file is somehow present.  It is not clear where it comes from, and each of these tests pass when run individually.  If you have mysterious issues, and you use __conda-version__.txt or files like it, please file an issue.

2016-06-15 1.21.0:
------------------

New stuff:
----------
 * Add FEATURE_ environment variables for MKL, opt and debugging #978
 * add info/about.json file that contains the "about" section of meta.yaml #941
 * allow ```--dirty``` flag to be passed to ```conda build``` command. Skips
   download, and provides DIRTY environment variable in build scripts. #973
 * Add msys2 paths to build and test environments #979
 * add new x86 and x86_64 selectors for Intel platforms #986
 * keep original meta.yaml in recipe folder of package; create meta.yaml.rendered in recipe folder.  Neither exist when recipe not included.  #1004
 * add ignore_prefix_files key to build in meta.yaml. Can ignore list of files,
   or True to ignore all prefix files. #1008 #1009
 * Automatically determine patch strip level #1011

Bug fixes/Improvements:
-----------------------
 * Lightened requirement that x.x be defined in both build and runtime sections.  #650
 * Remove info/recipe.json from build conda packages.  Superseded by info/recipe/meta.yaml.rendered.  #781
 * Search for single and double backslashes when finding files that need prefix replacement #962
 * Track undefined jinja variables and use them to decide whether to download source #964
 * handle patches with p0 or p1 #969, #1011, #1020
 * only set os.environ for non-None variables #981
 * Don't use long prefixes on windows #985
 * Fix missing encoding argument #987

 * Search packages on PyPI, rather than listing them all.  Should avoid some timeout errors there. #991
 * Fix unix-style paths returned from git on Windows preventing relative paths from providing Jinja2 metadata #995
 * improve logic handling "dirty" downloading.  Always download when not dirty.  #995
 * Fix post-build variables when no build section existed in original meta.yaml #999
 * Activate _build and _test environments approriately, rather than manipulating PATH directly #1002
 * Don't clone git submodules until after first checkout #1025
 * Move check_install over from conda.install #1027

Deprecations:
-------------
 * __conda_version__.txt and other post-build methods of altering the build
   string are marked as deprecated. Prefer Jinja2 templates where possible.
   Create issues if this breaks your work.

2016-05-13 1.20.3:
------------------
Features:
 * use posix metapackage for cran skeleton packaging (#956)

Bug fixes:
 * fix output of package paths (extra output was breaking tools).  Add tests. (#950)
 * change default of no_download_source in build.py (for compatibility with conda-build-all) (#950)
 * fix regression in [] being confused for selectors (#957)

2016-05-13 1.20.2:
------------------
Features:
 * added --token and --user flags to pass corresponding information to anaconda upload (#921)
 * added conda render command that outputs a fully-rendered meta.yaml to either stdout, or to file (with --file) (#908)
 * support source checkout tools specified in meta.yaml. If source checkout fails at the rendering phase, source checkout and rendering are re-done after the build environment is created. (#843, #946)
 * fn is now optional when a URL specifies a filename. (#942)
 * CRAN skeleton generator now uses MSYS2 for Windows support (#942)
 * conda build & conda render both recursively look for meta.yaml (support conda-forge feedstock submodules) (#908)
 * Whitelist MAKEFLAGS environment variable. Setting this outside conda build should take effect in your build. Parallelize on *nix by adding -j here, instead of -j${CPU_COUNT} in your build.sh. This helps on CI's, where CPU_COUNT is not always well-behaved. (#917)
 * Run python_d executable on windows when debug feature is active (#724)
 * add conda build flag --keep-old-work that temporarily moves your last build, then moves it back after completion. For debugging, when more than one package is involved. (#833)
 * Allow selectors in imported jinja templates (#739)

Bug fixes:
 * fixed several instances wherein --skip-existing did not work (#897, #945)
 * Fully render recipe before outputting build string  * fixes empty spots where GIT_* info should have been (#923)
 * Add MSYS2 path conversion filters to avoid issues with Win 7.1 SDK (#900)
 * Address PyPI's change of URL format (#922,
 * Fix invalid gcc "-m 32" flag (#916)
 * Fix empty section (due to selectors) handling regression (#919)
 * Fix regression in handling of VS2008 Pro (not Express + VC for Python 2.7). It is important to at least try to run vcvarsall.bat. (#913)
 * Fix CPAN skeleton generator (handle missing sections better) (#912)
 * Make test/requires versions match build/requires without additional pinning (#907)
 * Remove hard-coded CYGWIN path from conda-build's custom PATH (#903)
 * Source is downloaded before testing, fixing an issue where if build machine and some other test machine had different source, strange things happened. (#946)
 * Fix regression with Python 3.x fixing shebangs (#892)
 * Fix conda inspect crashes by using conda-meta info rather than filenames or dist names for package info (#947)

Miscellany:
 * restore AppVeyor testing for Windows builds (#864)
 * Build py3.5 on Appveyor (#938)
 * PEP8 cleanup; use flake8 rather than pyflakes (#938)
 * limited scope of project locking to avoid lock conflicts between build and rendering (#923)
 * set up anaconda.org build infrastructure (#924)
 * on Windows, environment variables are written to the temporary bld.bat in the source work folder. (#933)

  * use the placeholder prefix in text files rather than the build prefix
  * allow non-Python packages to be converted to other platforms with conda

-------------------
  * allow changing conda-bld directory (which is by default <root>/conda-bld
