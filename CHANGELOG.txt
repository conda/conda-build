  * add support for run_test.pl and Perl import tests when
    building Perl packages
  * add CONDA_PERL environment variable support for
    determining which version of Perl to build packages for.
    Unlike CONDA_PY, this must include the full version with

  * automatically build packages for dependencies if the recipe is
    present in the current working directory
  * fix a number of Python 3 compatibility issues, issue #59
  * work with source files with uppercase suffixes

  * export PKG Build Number
  * add pre-link to package, when it is found in recipe
  * allow to add run_test.sh or run_test.bat, which will be run automatically
    during the test phase.
  * Test commands from the test/commands section of meta.yaml are run from
    bash on Linux and OS X and batch on Windows (previously they were run
    using Python's subprocess).
  * all environment variables from the build process are available during the
    tests, except with the build prefix replaced with the test prefix.
