    this case)


2014-04-15   1.3.2:
-------------------
  * allow changing conda-bld directory (which is by default <root>/conda-bld
    when the conda root is not writable, and ~/conda-bld otherwise), to be

  * add the --recursive option to conda skeleton pypi
  * conda skeleton pypi no longer asks about single line licenses

    avoids anything bad that might happen when trying to get the metadata from
    the package from messing up the root environment.
  * conda skeleton pypi now patches distribute directly. This is more robust
    than trying to insert a patch into setup.py, as was done previously.
  * allow to set the version post-build by writing a __conda_version__.txt
    file to the source directory.
  * add ability to skip binary relocation step by
    setting "build/binary_relocation: False" in meta.yaml

    building Perl packages

    expects the full path to the recipe

  * allow to add run_test.sh or run_test.bat, which will be run automatically
    during the test phase.

    bash on Linux and OS X and batch on Windows (previously they were run
    using Python's subprocess).
