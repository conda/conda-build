2017-11-02 3.0.28:

2017-10-17 3.0.27:

Enhancements:
-------------

* For windows error checks, assert that the errorlevel is 0, rather than GEQ 1.  Makes negative return codes fail builds.  #2442

2017-01-02 2.1.0:

(includes changes since 2.0.12, including those already listed under 2.1.0beta1)

Enhancements:
-------------

* Consolidate package metadata from extra.json and noarch.json into package_metadata.json #1535 #1539
* finalize paths.json, (formerly files.json), which supersedes the older separate files for tracking file data #1535
* Support output of multiple packages from one recipe #1576
* Support output of wheels #1576
* Add ``--prefix-length`` to conda-build.  This allows one to set the prefix length manually.  It should be used sparingly, preferring creation of a temporary folder on non-encrypted locations, and setting ``--croot`` to that temporary folder.  #1579
* Add ``--no-prefix-length-fallback`` option to conda-build, to fail builds that encounter short prefixes, rather than falling back to the short prefix #1579
* Change CRAN-skeleton to follow conda-forge style #1596
* Allow relative paths to files in source/url field #1614

Bug fixes:
----------

* Rework locks to be more robust #1540
* Call make_hardlink_copy on Windows to prevent conda failures #1575
* Delete the work folder before running the test suite.  Exposes faulty links to source files more easily.  #1581
* Add support for Python 3.6 in selector expressions #1592
* Don't try to compile pyc files when python is not installed in the build env #1593
* Fix a function call leading to corrupted meta.yaml output #1589
* Fix logger to be package-local.  Fixes logger output not showing up.  #1583
* Disallow leading periods in package version  #1594
* Fix reference to undefined need_source_download #1595
* Disallow - in feature names, to avoid conflicts with conda's handling of package names #1600
* Remove help text about passing multiple --python options or "all" - this has been broken for some time.  Replacement coming in 3.0.0.  #1610
* Fix clobbering of no_link variable.  #1611
* Fix index when --output-folder is specified #1613
* Fix python_d.exe incompatibility with conda 4.3 #1615

2016-07-05 1.21.4:
------------------

Bug fixes:
----------

Known issues:
-------------

 * Environment activation requires conda >=4.1.6.  The activate.bat script does not look in the right place for the activate.d folder.
 * The test suite on Linux and Mac fails the python-build, python-run, and python-build-run tests, because an errant __conda-version__.txt file is somehow present.  It is not clear where it comes from, and each of these tests pass when run individually.  If you have mysterious issues, and you use __conda-version__.txt or files like it, please file an issue.

 * Improve notion of whether a recipe uses a VCS in its metadata, or in its build

Known issues:
-------------

 * The test suite on Linux and Mac fails the python-build, python-run, and python-build-run tests, because an errant __conda-version__.txt file is somehow present.  It is not clear where it comes from, and each of these tests pass when run individually.  If you have mysterious issues, and you use __conda-version__.txt or files like it, please file an issue.

2016-06-15 1.21.0:
------------------

New stuff:
----------
 * Add FEATURE_ environment variables for MKL, opt and debugging #978
 * add info/about.json file that contains the "about" section of meta.yaml #941
 * allow ```--dirty``` flag to be passed to ```conda build``` command. Skips
   download, and provides DIRTY environment variable in build scripts. #973
 * Add msys2 paths to build and test environments #979
 * add new x86 and x86_64 selectors for Intel platforms #986
 * keep original meta.yaml in recipe folder of package; create meta.yaml.rendered in recipe folder.  Neither exist when recipe not included.  #1004
 * add ignore_prefix_files key to build in meta.yaml. Can ignore list of files,
   or True to ignore all prefix files. #1008 #1009
 * Automatically determine patch strip level #1011

Bug fixes/Improvements:
-----------------------
 * Lightened requirement that x.x be defined in both build and runtime sections.  #650

 * improve logic handling "dirty" downloading.  Always download when not dirty.  #995
 * Fix post-build variables when no build section existed in original meta.yaml #999
 * Activate _build and _test environments approriately, rather than manipulating PATH directly #1002
 * Don't clone git submodules until after first checkout #1025
 * Move check_install over from conda.install #1027

Deprecations:
-------------
 * __conda_version__.txt and other post-build methods of altering the build
   string are marked as deprecated. Prefer Jinja2 templates where possible.
   Create issues if this breaks your work.

2016-05-13 1.20.3:
------------------
Features:
 * use posix metapackage for cran skeleton packaging (#956)

Bug fixes:

 * change default of no_download_source in build.py (for compatibility with conda-build-all) (#950)
 * fix regression in [] being confused for selectors (#957)

2016-05-13 1.20.2:
------------------
Features:
 * added --token and --user flags to pass corresponding information to anaconda upload (#921)
 * added conda render command that outputs a fully-rendered meta.yaml to either stdout, or to file (with --file) (#908)
 * support source checkout tools specified in meta.yaml. If source checkout fails at the rendering phase, source checkout and rendering are re-done after the build environment is created. (#843, #946)
 * fn is now optional when a URL specifies a filename. (#942)
 * CRAN skeleton generator now uses MSYS2 for Windows support (#942)
 * conda build & conda render both recursively look for meta.yaml (support conda-forge feedstock submodules) (#908)
 * Whitelist MAKEFLAGS environment variable. Setting this outside conda build should take effect in your build. Parallelize on *nix by adding -j here, instead of -j${CPU_COUNT} in your build.sh. This helps on CI's, where CPU_COUNT is not always well-behaved. (#917)
 * Run python_d executable on windows when debug feature is active (#724)
 * add conda build flag --keep-old-work that temporarily moves your last build, then moves it back after completion. For debugging, when more than one package is involved. (#833)

Bug fixes:
 * fixed several instances wherein --skip-existing did not work (#897, #945)
 * Fully render recipe before outputting build string  * fixes empty spots where GIT_* info should have been (#923)

 * Fix invalid gcc "-m 32" flag (#916)
 * Fix empty section (due to selectors) handling regression (#919)
 * Fix regression in handling of VS2008 Pro (not Express + VC for Python 2.7). It is important to at least try to run vcvarsall.bat. (#913)
 * Fix CPAN skeleton generator (handle missing sections better) (#912)
 * Make test/requires versions match build/requires without additional pinning (#907)
 * Remove hard-coded CYGWIN path from conda-build's custom PATH (#903)
 * Source is downloaded before testing, fixing an issue where if build machine and some other test machine had different source, strange things happened. (#946)
 * Fix regression with Python 3.x fixing shebangs (#892)
 * Fix conda inspect crashes by using conda-meta info rather than filenames or dist names for package info (#947)

-------------------
  * allow changing conda-bld directory (which is by default <root>/conda-bld

    than trying to insert a patch into setup.py, as was done previously.
