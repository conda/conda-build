Overview
========

This tutorial describes how to build a conda package for
Click by writing the required files in the conda-build recipe.

Who is this for?
================

This tutorial is for Windows, macOS, and Linux users who wish to
generate a conda package by writing the necessary files.
Prior knowledge of conda-build and conda recipes is helpful.


.. _before-you-start2:

Before you start
================

* Check the :doc:`prerequisites <index>`.

* You should have already completed :doc:`build-pkgs-skeleton`.


.. _edit-meta-yaml:

Editing the meta.yaml file
===========================

#. Make a new directory for this tutorial named ``click``,
   and then change to the new directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

     mkdir click
     cd click

#. To create a new ``meta.yaml`` file, open your favorite editor.
   Create a new text file and insert the information shown below.
   A blank sample ``meta.yaml`` follows the table to make it
   easier to match up the information.

   .. note::
      To allow correct sorting and comparison, specify
      ``version`` as a string.

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 10 90

      * - name
        - click
      * - version
        - "7.0" (or latest from
          https://github.com/pallets/click/releases)
      * - git_rev
        - 6.7 (or latest from
          https://github.com/pallets/click/releases)
      * - git_url
        - https://github.com/pallets/click.git
      * - imports
        - click
      * - home
        - https://github.com/pallets/click
      * - license
        - BSD

   .. code-block:: yaml

     package:
       name:
       version:

     source:
       git_rev:
       git_url:

     requirements:
       build:
         - python
         - setuptools

       run:
         - python

     test:
       imports:

     about:
       home:

#. Save the file in the same ``click``
   directory as ``meta.yaml``. It should match :download:`this
   meta.yaml file <meta.yaml>`.


.. _build-sh-bld-bat:

Writing the build script files build.sh and bld.bat
====================================================

Besides ``meta.yaml``, 2 files are required for a build:

* ``build.sh``---Shell script for macOS and Linux.
* ``bld.bat``---Batch file for Windows.

These 2 build files contain all the variables, such as for 32-bit
or 64-bit architecture---the ARCH variable---and the build
environment prefix---PREFIX. The 2 files ``build.sh`` and
``bld.bat`` must be in the same directory as your ``meta.yaml``
file.

This tutorial describes how to make both ``build.sh`` and
``bld.bat`` so that other users can build the appropriate package
for their architecture.

#. Open a text editor and create a new file named ``bld.bat``.
   Type the text exactly as shown:

   .. code-block:: bash

       "%PYTHON%" setup.py install
       if errorlevel 1 exit 1

   .. note::
      In ``bld.bat``, the best practice is to to add
      ``if errorlevel 1 exit 1`` after every command so that if the
      command fails, the build fails.

#. Save this new file ``bld.bat`` to the same directory where
   you put your ``meta.yaml`` file.

#. Open a text editor and create a new file named ``build.sh``.
   Enter the text exactly as shown:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $PYTHON setup.py install     # Python command to install the script.


#. Save your new ``build.sh`` file to the same directory where you
   put the ``meta.yaml`` file.

You can run ``build.sh`` with ``bash -x -e``. The ``-x`` makes it
echo each command that is run, and the ``-e`` makes it exit
whenever a command in the script returns nonzero exit status. If
you need to revert this in the script, use the ``set`` command
in ``build.sh``.


.. _build-and-install:

Building and installing
========================

Now that you have your 3 new build files ready, you are ready to
create your new package with conda-build and install the package
on your local computer.

#. Run conda-build:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda-build click

   If you are already in the click folder, you can type ``conda-build .``.



   When conda-build is finished, it displays the package filename
   and location. In this case the file is saved to:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ~/anaconda/conda-bld/linux-64/click-7.0-py37_0.tar.bz2


   .. note::
      Save this path and file information for the next task.
      The exact path and filename vary depending on your operating
      system and whether you are using Anaconda or Miniconda.
      The ``conda-build`` command tells you the exact path and
      filename.

#. Install your newly built program on your local computer
   by using the ``use-local`` flag:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda install --use-local click

   If there are no error messages, Click installed
   successfully.

   .. note::
      Explicitly installing a local package bypasses the dependency
      resolver, as such the package's ``run`` dependencies will not
      be evaluated. See `conda install --help` or the `install command reference
      page <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/install.html>`_
      for more info.


.. _convert:

Converting a package for use on all platforms
=============================================

Now that you have built a package for your current platform with
conda-build, you can convert it for use on other platforms by
using the 2 build files, ``build.sh`` and ``bld.bat``.

Use the ``conda convert`` command with a platform specifier from
the list:

* ``osx-64``.
* ``linux-32``.
* ``linux-64``.
* ``win-32``.
* ``win-64``.
* ``all``.

EXAMPLE: Using the platform specifier ``all``:

.. code-block:: bash

     conda convert --platform all ~/anaconda/conda-bld/linux-64/click-7.0-py37_0.tar.bz2 -o outputdir/


.. note::
   Change your path and filename to the path and
   filename you saved in :ref:`build-and-install`.


.. _pypi-source:

Optional---Using PyPI as the source instead of GitHub
======================================================

You can use PyPI or another repository instead of GitHub. There
is little difference to conda-build between building from Git
versus building from a tarball on a repository like PyPI. Because
the same source is hosted on PyPI and GitHub, you can easily find
a script on PyPI instead of GitHub.

Replace this ``source`` section:

.. code-block:: bash

   git_rev: v0.6.7
   git_url: https://github.com/pallets/click.git

With the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    url: https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f8/5c/f60e9d8a1e77005f664b76ff8aeaee5bc05d0a91798afd7f53fc998dbc47/Click-7.0.tar.gz
    sha256: 5b94b49521f6456670fdb30cd82a4eca9412788a93fa6dd6df72c94d5a8ff2d7


.. note::
   The ``url`` and ``sha256`` are found on the `PyPI Click page
   <https://pypi.org/project/click/#files>`_.


.. _anaconda-org:

Optional---Uploading new packages to Anaconda.org
=================================================

After converting your files for use on other platforms, you may
choose to upload your files to Anaconda.org, formerly known as binstar.org.
It only takes a minute to do if you have a free Anaconda.org account.

#. If you have not done so already, open a free Anaconda.org account
   and record your new user name and password.

#. Run the command ``conda install anaconda-client``, and then
   enter your Anaconda.org username and password.

#. Log into your `Anaconda.org <http://anaconda.org>`_ account
   with the command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      anaconda login

#. Upload your package to Anaconda.org:

   .. code-block:: bash

      anaconda upload ~/miniconda/conda-bld/linux-64/click-7.0-py37_0.tar.bz2


   .. note::
      Change your path and filename to the path and
      filename you saved in :ref:`build-and-install`.

   .. tip::
      To save time, you can set conda to always
      upload a successful build to Anaconda.org
      with the command: ``conda config --set anaconda_upload yes``.

.. _more-resources:

More information
================

* For more information about all the possible values that can go
  into the ``meta.yaml`` file, see
  :doc:`../../resources/define-metadata`.
