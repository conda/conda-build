============================
Using wheel files with conda
============================

If you have software in a `Python wheel file <https://pythonwheels.com/>`_ and
want to use it with conda or install it in a conda environment, there are 3
ways.

The best way is to obtain the source code for the software and build a conda
package from the source and not from a wheel. This helps ensure that the new
package uses other conda packages to satisfy its dependencies.

The second best way is to build a conda package from the wheel file. This tells
conda more about the files present than a pip install. It is also less likely
than a pip install to cause errors by overwriting (or "clobbering") files.
Building a conda package from the wheel file also has the advantage that any
clobbering is more likely to happen at build time and not runtime.

The third way is to use pip to install a wheel file into a conda environment.
Some conda users have used this option safely. The first 2 ways are still the
safest and most reliable.


Building a conda package from a wheel file
==========================================

To build a conda package from a wheel file, install the .whl file in the conda
recipe's ``bld.bat`` or ``build.sh`` file.

You may download the .whl file in the source section of the conda recipe's
``meta.yaml`` file.

You may instead put the URL directly in the ``pip install`` command.

EXAMPLE: The conda recipe for TensorFlow has a ``pip install`` command in
`build.sh <https://github.com/conda/conda-recipes/blob/a796713805ac8eceed191c0cb475b51f4d00718c/python/tensorflow/build.sh#L7>`_
with the URL of a .whl file. The
`meta.yaml <https://github.com/conda/conda-recipes/blob/a796713805ac8eceed191c0cb475b51f4d00718c/python/tensorflow/meta.yaml>`_
file does not download or list the .whl file.

.. note::
   It is important to ``pip install`` only the one desired package. Whenever
   possible, install dependencies with conda and not pip.

You must use the ``--no-deps`` option in the ``pip install`` command in order
to avoid bundling dependencies into your conda-package.

If you run ``pip install`` without the ``--no-deps`` option, pip will often
install dependencies in your conda recipe and those dependencies will become
part of your package. This wastes space in the package and increases the
risk of file overlap, file clobbering, and broken packages.
