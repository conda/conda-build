=================================================
Building a package without a recipe (bdist_conda)
=================================================

You can use conda-build to build packages for Python to install
rather than conda by using ``setup.py bdist_conda``. This is a
quick way to build packages without using a recipe, but it has
limitations. The script is limited to the Python version used in
the build and it is not as reproducible as using a recipe. We
recommend using a recipe with conda-build.

.. note::
   If you use Setuptools, you must first import Setuptools and
   then import ``conda_build.bdist_conda``, because Setuptools
   monkey patches ``distutils.dist.Distribution``.

EXAMPLE: A minimal ``setup.py`` file using the setup options
``name`` and ``version``:

.. code::

   from setuptools import setup
   import conda_build.bdist_conda

  setup(
      name="foo",
      version="1.0",
      distclass=conda_build.bdist_conda.CondaDistribution,
      conda_buildnum=1,
  )


Setup options
=============

You can pass the following options to ``setup()``. You must
include ``distclass=conda_build.bdist_conda.CondaDistribution``.

Build number
------------

The number of the build. Can be overridden on the command line
with the ``--buildnum`` flag. Defaults to ``0``.

.. code::

   conda_buildnum=1


Build string
------------

The build string. Default is generated automatically from the
Python version, NumPy version---if relevant---and the build
number, such as ``py34_0``.

.. code::

   conda_buildstr=py34_0


Import tests
------------

Whether to automatically run import tests. The default is
``True``, which runs import tests for all the modules in
``packages``. Also allowed are ``False``, which runs no tests, or
a list of module names to be tested on import.

.. code::

   conda_import_tests=False


Command line tests
------------------

Command line tests to run. Default is ``True``, which runs
``command --help`` for each command in the console_scripts and
gui_scripts entry_points. Also allowed are ``False``, which does
not run any command tests, or a list of command tests to run.

.. code::

   conda_command_tests=False


Binary files relocatable
------------------------

Whether binary files should be made relocatable, using
install_name_tool on macOS or patchelf on Linux. The default is
``True``.

.. code::

   conda_binary_relocation=False

For more information, see :ref:`Making packages relocatable <make-relocatable>`.


Preserve egg directory
----------------------

Whether to preserve the egg directory as installed by Setuptools.
The default is ``True`` if the package depends on Setuptools or
has Setuptools entry_points other than console_scripts and
gui_scripts.

.. code::

   conda_preserve_egg_dir=False


Command line options
====================

Build number
------------

Set the build number. Defaults to the conda_buildnum passed
to ``setup()`` or ``0``. Overrides any conda_buildnum passed to
``setup()``.

.. code::

   --buildnum=1


Notes
=====

* You must install ``bdist_conda`` into a root conda environment,
  as it imports ``conda`` and ``conda_build``. It is included as
  part of the ``conda-build`` package.

* All metadata is gathered from the standard metadata from the
  ``setup()`` function. Metadata that are not directly supported
  by ``setup()`` can be added using one of the options specified
  above.

* By default, import tests are run for each subpackage specified
  by packages, and command line tests ``command --help`` are run
  for each ``setuptools entry_points`` command. This is done to
  ensure that the package is built correctly. You can disable or
  change these using the ``conda_import_tests`` and
  ``conda_command_tests`` options specified above.

* The Python version used in the build must be the same as where
  conda is installed, as ``bdist_conda`` uses ``conda-build``.

* ``bdist_conda`` uses the metadata provided to the ``setup()``
  function.

* If you want to pass any ``bdist_conda`` specific options to
  ``setup()``, in ``setup()`` you must set
  ``distclass=conda_build.bdist_conda.CondaDistribution``.
