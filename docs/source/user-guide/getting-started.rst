Before starting the tutorials, consider reviewing

and :doc:`conda-build concepts <../../concepts/index>`.

You may also find our :doc:`resources <../../resources/index>`

.. _prereqs:

Prerequisites
=============

Before starting the tutorials, you need to install:

- `Miniconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/>`_ or `Anaconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/>`_
- conda-build
- Git

The most straightforward way to do this is to install Miniconda or
Anaconda, which contain conda, and then use conda to install conda-build
and Git. Make sure you install these packages into your base environment.::

    conda install -n base conda-build git

For more information on installing and updating conda-build, see :doc:`Installing and updating conda-build <../install-conda-build>`.
