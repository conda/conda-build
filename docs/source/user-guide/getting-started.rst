Getting started

Before starting the tutorials, consider reviewing
:doc:`how to install and update conda-build <../../install-conda-build>`
and :doc:`conda-build concepts <../../concepts/index>`.

You may also find our :doc:`resources <../../resources/index>`
collection helpful.

Prerequisites
=============

Before starting the tutorials, you need to install:

- `Miniconda or Anaconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/>`_
- conda-build
- Git

The most straightforward way to do this is to install Miniconda or
Anaconda, which contain conda, and then use conda to install conda-build
and Git. Make sure you install these packages into a new environment
and not your base environment.::

    conda create -n my-conda-build-environment conda-build git

Have an idea for a tutorial? You can submit your suggestions
to Anaconda by emailing us at `documentation@anaconda.com`_.

To create your own tutorials, follow the
:doc:`writing style guide <../resources/style-guide>`
and :doc:`tutorial template <../resources/tutorial-template>`.
