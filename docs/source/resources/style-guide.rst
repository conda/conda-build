===================
Writing style guide
===================

Follow these guidelines for submitting
or editing conda-build documentation.

Audience
========
Identify who your audience is, their skill level,
and how they can use the information.

Technical language
==================
Match the level of technical language with the audience's
level of proficiency. It's better to uderestimate the
knowledge of your readers than overestimate it.
Limit technical terms to those the user will encounter.
If you must define a large number of terms, use a glossary
to supplement definitions in the text.

Addressing the user
===================
Use the active voice (e.g. Click this) and address
users directly (write "you" rather than "the user").
When explaining an action, use the "command" form of
the verb: "Choose an option from the menu and press Enter."

Format
======
See the :doc:`tutorial template <tutorial-template>`
for the format. Provide descriptive task and subtask titles and
do not number headings.
