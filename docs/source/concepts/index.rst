What is a “package”?
--------------------

* A package is anything you install using your package manager

* A "conda package" is a compressed tarball or `.conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/packages.html#conda-file-format>`_
  file that contains

  * the module to be installed

  * information on how to install the package

* You can use conda-build to build a conda package

What about channels
-------------------

* Channels contain packages

* They conform to a standard structure and contain an index
  of available packages

* An index of the available packages can be generated by running a

.. code-block:: bash

  $ conda index <path to channel>

* conda is able to install from channels and uses the indexes in the channel to
  solve for requirements and dependencies

Building Anaconda installers
----------------------------

* Anaconda(/Miniconda) installers are built with a modified version
  of constructor.

* The idea is to build an Anaconda metapackage and bundle it together with some
  other packages to build an Anaconda installer.
