Package naming conventions
==========================

To facilitate communication and documentation, conda observes the
package naming conventions listed below.

**Package name**
    The name of a package, without any reference to a particular
    version. Conda package names are normalized and they may contain
    only lowercase alpha characters, numeric digits, underscores,
    hyphens, or dots. In usage documentation, these are referred to
    by ``package_name``.

**Package version**
    A version number or string, often similar to ``X.Y`` or
    ``X.Y.Z``, but it may take other forms as well.

**Build string**
    An arbitrary string that identifies a particular build of a
    package for conda. It may contain suggestive mnemonics, but
    these are subject to change, and you should not rely on it or try
    to parse it for any specific information.

**Canonical name**
    The package name, version, and build string joined together by
    hyphens: name-version-buildstring. In usage documentation, these
    are referred to by ``canonical_name``.

**Filename**
    Conda package filenames are canonical names, plus the suffix
    ``.tar.bz2`` or ``.conda``.

The following figure compares a canonical name to a filename:

Conda supports both ``.conda`` and ``.tar.bz2`` package extensions. The ``.conda``
format is generally smaller and more efficient than ``.tar.bz2`` packages.

The build string is created as the package is built. Things that
contribute to it are the variants specified either by the command
line or the configuration from the ``conda_build_config.yaml``, and the
build number in the recipe. If there are no variants,
then the build string is the build number that is specified in the recipe.

Package specification
=====================

A package name together with a package version — which may be
partial or absent — joined by an equal sign.

Examples:

* ``python=2.7.3``
* ``python=2.7``
* ``python``

In usage documentation, these are referred to by ``package_spec``.
